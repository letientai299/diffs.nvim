**Treesitter-powered Diff Syntax highlighting for Neovim**

Enhance Neovim's built-in diff mode (and much more!) with language-aware syntax
highlighting driven by treesitter.

## Features

- Treesitter syntax highlighting in vim-fugitive, Neogit, and `diff` filetype
- Character-level intra-line diff highlighting (with optional
  [vscode-diff](https://github.com/esmuellert/codediff.nvim) FFI backend for
  word-level accuracy)
- `:Gdiff` unified diff against any revision
- Inline merge conflict detection, highlighting, and resolution
- gitsigns.nvim blame popup highlighting
- Email quoting/patch syntax support (`> diff ...`)
- Vim syntax fallback
- Configurable highlighiting blend & priorities
- Context-inclusive, high-accuracy highlights

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.9.0+

## Installation

Install with your package manager of choice or via
[luarocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/barrettruth/diffs.nvim):

```
luarocks install diffs.nvim
```

## Documentation

```vim
:help diffs.nvim
```

## FAQ

**Q: How do I install with lazy.nvim?**

```lua
{
  'barrettruth/diffs.nvim',
  init = function()
    vim.g.diffs = {
      ...
    }
  end,
}
```

Do not lazy load `diffs.nvim` with `event`, `lazy`, `ft`, `config`, or `keys` to
control loading - `diffs.nvim` lazy-loads itself.

**Q: Does diffs.nvim support vim-fugitive/Neogit/gitsigns?**

Yes. Enable integrations in your config:

```lua
vim.g.diffs = {
  fugitive = true,
  neogit = true,
  gitsigns = true,
}
```

See the documentation for more information.

## Known Limitations

- **Incomplete syntax context**: Treesitter parses each diff hunk in isolation.
  Context lines within the hunk provide syntactic context for the parser. In
  rare cases, hunks that start or end mid-expression may produce imperfect
  highlights due to treesitter error recovery.

- **Syntax "flashing"**: `diffs.nvim` hooks into the `FileType fugitive` event
  triggered by `vim-fugitive`, at which point the buffer is preliminarily
  painted. The decoration provider applies highlights on the next redraw cycle,
  causing a brief visual "flash".

- **Cold Start**: Treesitter grammar loading (~10ms) and query compilation
  (~4ms) are one-time costs per language per Neovim session. Each language pays
  this cost on first encounter, which may cause a brief stutter when a diff
  containing a new language first enters the viewport.

- **Vim syntax fallback is deferred**: The vim syntax fallback (for languages
  without a treesitter parser) cannot run inside the decoration provider's
  redraw cycle due to Neovim's restriction on buffer mutations. Vim syntax
  highlights for these hunks appear slightly delayed.

- **Conflicting diff plugins**: `diffs.nvim` may not interact well with other
  plugins that modify diff highlighting. Known plugins that may conflict:
  - [`diffview.nvim`](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim) - provides its
    own diff highlighting and conflict resolution UI
  - [`mini.diff`](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.diff) - visualizes buffer
    differences with its own highlighting system
  - [`gitsigns.nvim`](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) - generally
    compatible, but both plugins modifying line highlights may produce
    unexpected results
  - [`git-conflict.nvim`](https://github.com/akinsho/git-conflict.nvim) -
    `diffs.nvim` now includes built-in conflict resolution; disable one or the
    other to avoid overlap
